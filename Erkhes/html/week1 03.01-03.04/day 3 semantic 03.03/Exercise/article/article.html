    <h1>How Schools Use Virtual Reality to Improve Education</h1>
    <p>
      Given the growth of VR within education, and the positive response from
      schools, we wouldnâ€™t be surprised if VR made it onto the curriculum at
      some point in the future. Curriculum aligned content and structured VR
      lesson plans have already been developed and are available in the UK.
